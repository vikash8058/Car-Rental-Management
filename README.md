The Car Rental Management System is a console-based Java application built using JDBC and MySQL that simulates real-world car rental operations. It provides an easy and secure way to manage cars, rentals, and users through a clean, role-based access system.

The application supports two types of users:

Owners: Can register cars, view all vehicles, and track rental transactions.

Customers: Can register themselves, log in, view available cars, rent cars, and return them.

Key operations such as car availability updates, rental tracking, and secure login are handled through a relational database (MySQL), making the system robust, scalable, and closer to real-world enterprise applications.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of:

Core Java concepts (OOP, classes, interfaces)

JDBC for database connectivity

SQL for data management

Role-based authentication and dashboard management

It is ideal for students, interns, and beginner developers seeking hands-on experience with Java + database-driven applications.
